# node-ip-geolocation
This npm package is designed to efficiently retrieve the geolocation data of a given public IP address or the user's own public IP address. The package provides two core functionalities:

Geolocation for Specific IP Address: Allows you to input any valid public IP address and retrieve detailed geolocation data such as the continent, country, region, city, latitude, longitude, timezone, and even the associated internet service provider (ISP).
Geolocation for Public IP of the User: Automatically fetches the user's public IP address using a reliable external service and retrieves its geolocation details. This is especially useful for applications where you need to provide location-based features without requiring user input.

This package is ideal for use cases such as personalized content delivery, analytics, security enhancements (e.g., IP-based restrictions), and location-aware applications. It features robust error handling to provide clear and structured feedback in cases of invalid input or network issues.
